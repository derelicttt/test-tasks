## Main:
- Select 4 blocks to execute(header, footer and 2 others). 
- Using build system(gulp, grunt or webpack).
- Using JS ES6.
- Using some preprocessor for CSS.
- 100% adaptability (min-width 360px).
- Pixel Perfect (5px variation allowed).

## Header (required):
- The menu must be fixed at the top of the window. 
- By clicking on the nav item, the page should scroll to the appropriate block on the page, and the item will become active.
- Mobile menu (window width <1024px) - burger menu.

## Banner - slider with videos (selective):
- The section must have height 100vh.
- The slider includes background(with video) and text with a button.
- For slider you can use some library.
- For video using YouTube API.
- Video on the active slide must autoplay when page load.
- When switching between slides, the video on the active slide should be played and stopped on the previous slide.
- When the user scroll the page down video stopped.

## Services (selective):
- [The point](point.png) must move along the path when page scrolling. 
- For animations you can use some library. I did it with help TweenMax:)
- On smaller devices(< 1200px) you can hide animations.
- [Video example](example-services.mov).

## Team (selective):
- It must be slider-carousel.
- You can use some library.
- When switching between slides, content, images, pagination must change.
- [Video example](example-team.mov).

## Contacts (selective):
- You must use Google Maps API;
- When user click on address the corresponding marker on the map becomes active and information change. 
- [Video example](example-contacts.mov).

## Footer (required): 
- By clicking on the nav item, the page should scroll to the appropriate block on the page.

## A big plus will be:
- Using naming methodology for CSS (BEM, SMACSS, OOCSS).
- Using some HTML-preprocessor(pug, nunjucks, etc).
- HTML semantic.
- HTML validation.
- HTML accessibility.
